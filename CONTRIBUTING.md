# Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to MagickScience. MagickScience is a project that's starting, but it already has features you can use.

## 1. Reporting bugs

If you find any bug when using MagickScience Units, or something that doesn't match the documentation, you can report it by creating a new issue at GitHub, under the [Issues tab](https://github.com/iarfen/MagickScience/issues/).

## 2. Suggesting features

If you think a new feature, not documented inside the TODO list, is important to be added, you can email 'Ismael Correa', the maintainer, at ismael.correa.castro@gmail.com.

## 3. Do you want to participate?

You can join MagickScience by requesting it to 'Ismael Correa' at ismael.correa.castro@gmail.com.
