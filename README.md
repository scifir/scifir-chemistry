# MagickScience

Hello! MagickScience is a scientific library for developing lab machines. It provides units, molecules, among other features, to allow developers of scientific software to develop their software easily. Enjoy!

MagickScience is under development, but the units are already released. Molecules aren't, but they will by ready soon!

## Units

MagickScience includes special units to use, then it's unneeded to care about having the proper dimensions and prefixes when developing scientific software. Learn how to use them at the [Wiki](https://github.com/Iarfen/MagickScience/wiki/).

## Atoms and molecules

MagickScience has atoms and molecules to use inside scientific software! It's under development, but a big amount is ready. It'll be completed in some months!

## Team

MagickScience is developed by [Ismael Correa](https://github.com/Iarfen/), a software developer of 27 years old. You can email if you find bugs, request new features, or have any other need, at ismael.correa.castro@gmail.com.
